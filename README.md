This repository contains the work for the zero week's solar data discovery challenge.

## Environment Setup

To reproduce the development environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/zemawi/Solar_Radiation-week0.git]

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Solar_Radiation-week0
    ```

3.  **Create a Python virtual environment (using venv):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv   # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
    ```

    (You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt)

5.  **(Optional) Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Currently, `requirements.txt` is empty, but this step is included for future use.).
